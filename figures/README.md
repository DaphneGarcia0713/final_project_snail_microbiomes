## 07_Composition:
These image files include stacked and faceted barplots of the abundance of phylums in the snail-microbiome samples, divided by temperature and sex, as well as boxplots of relative abundance of Pseudomonadota, Bacillota, Bacteroidetes, and Desulfobacteria phyla; and boxplots of genera and top ASVs within the phyla, grouped by temperature.

## 06_Ordination:
These image files include PCoA and NMDS plots using Bray-Curtis and Sørensen dissimilarities, as well as histograms and scatterplots exploring sequence depth and ASV distributions in both raw and scaled datasets.

## 05_Biodiversity:
These image files include rarefaction curves and box plots of hill richness, hill-shannon, and hill-simpson alpha diversity metrics of all six experimental groups of temperature and sex in the study’s snail microbiomes.

## 04_Phylogenetic_Tree
These image files include raw and pruned kingdom-level phylogenetic trees, in addition to magnified nodes in order to identify the most recent common ancestor of eukaryotic and suspicious nodes.

## 03_PreProcessing:
One image file contains a barplot, histogram, and density plot of sequencing depth of the reads in all samples

## 02_Assign_ASVs:
These image files include bar plots of the ASV lengths throughout the trimming process, and inspecting number of ASVs per sequences and samples

## 01_QualityTrimming:
These image files include plots of pre- and post- quality trimmed reads, comparing quality score between the two groups
