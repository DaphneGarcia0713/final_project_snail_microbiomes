This subdirectory contains the raw physeq and raw preprocessed physeq objects outputted by 
`analysis/03_PreProcessing.Rmd`

## 04_PhylogeneticTree
This subdirectory contains midpoint rooted tree, along with the intermediate MAFFT and FastTree data files outputted by 04A and 04B Rmdâ€™s `analysis/04A_Phylogenetic_tree`

## 05_Biodiversity
This subdirectory contains iNEXT data to be used by  `analysis/05_Biodiversity`

## 06_Ordination 
This subdirectory contains the scaled physeq object created by  `analysis/06_Ordination`

## Accessions.txt and Metatada.csv
