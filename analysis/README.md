### README for `final_project_snail_microbiomes` R project ###


Apple snails are invasive  and constantly breaching environments with a variety of temperatures, making it important to accurately discern how temperature affects the bacterial diversity in their intestinal microbiomes. Understanding how the alpha and beta diversity of pathogenic vs immune-linked phyla change with respect to temperature is essential for revealing how thermal conditions influence their microbiomes.

The data was taken from BioProject `PRJNA843708`, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA843708

The authors raised Pomacea candiculata at three temperature groups: low (25C) control (30C) and high (35C), and after 14 days, sampled intestinal contents of 10 male and female snails respectively.

The authors sampled 16S rRNA genes with V3-4 region primers 341F and  806R (Dao et al., 2021), with expected length of 465bp, on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 paired end.
341F (5′-CCTAYGGGRBGCASCAG-3′), 806R (5′-GGACTACNNGGGTATCTAAT-3′)
